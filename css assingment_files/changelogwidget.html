Hashnode on the fly. Check more details <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://townhall.hashnode.com/create-new-tags-on-the-fly">here</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Schedule Articles</strong></p><p>Now you won’t have to be active at the time to publish your articles. You can pick a future date (up to 6 months) and set the scheduled date. If you decide that you want to remove the scheduling, you can do so and then decide to edit the draft further or set a different scheduling date.</p><p><br>All of the articles (published and scheduled) can be seen on the dashboard posts page for their posts. This is where you can cancel the scheduling. For now, while an article is scheduled it will be removed from drafts and will not be accessible for editing until published or scheduling is cancelled. You can still visit the preview of the draft while it is scheduled.</p><img src="./4c74585c01f720d1e8adb67e6fe74c94"><img src="./8b9b276789e0a3bd8d4ee3d08ed92ea8"><img src="./96d6070e708b1c3fd31fd70f70e21545"></li></ul><p></p><ul><li><p><strong>Post Scheduling Notifications</strong></p><p>We already have a notification on a scheduled article being published to the author.</p><p>New notifications are:</p><ul><li><p>Notification to the author for successful scheduling.</p></li><li><p>Successful scheduling notification to other publication admins if it's a team publication.</p></li><li><p>Scheduled article published notification to publication admins if it’s a team publication.</p></li></ul><p></p><img src="./21e87f6e136afa03536503d45443d0ac"><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>Support for www Subdomain Redirection to Apex Domain</strong></p><p>Now you have the option to map and redirect the <code>www</code> subdomain to your primary apex custom domain.</p><p>This works only for apex domains (ex: <code>hashnode.xyz</code>) and not for subdomains (ex: <code>blog.hashnode.xyz</code>).</p><p>When you add a custom domain from Blog Dashboard &gt; Domains page, a prompt will open up to get user’s preference (Note: the prompt will only show up for apex domains as mentioned earlier). User can choose to map the <code>www</code> subdomain as well or only map the primary apex domain.</p><img src="./65990f63ef5a2605d03d4fffeb491bef"><p>If you select the option to also map <code>www</code> subdomain, we will automatically assign an SSL certificate and redirect the www subdomain to primary domain (ex: the above screenshot maps <code>www.hashnode.xyz</code> and redirects to <code>hashnode.xyz</code>). If you select, only map apex domain, then the flow is normal as before.</p><p><br>You will always have the option to map www subdomain anytime from the <code>Blog Dashboard &gt; Domain page</code>.

Primarily for existing custom domains as this wasn’t available).</p><p></p><img src="./fc8e8f82da9591b340dd0be3be8cf7f3"><p>Click <code>Map and Redirect</code> to map the <code>www</code> subdomain and redirect to primary apex domain.</p><img src="./2383e4590e8ae4d01e78a8f5a0bdeab4"><p>Once the <code>www</code> subdomain has SSL Cert issued and is ready, the redirect will be effective.</p><p>Users will also need to add the <code>CNAME</code> record with Host as <code>www</code> and value <code>hashnode.network</code> for the <code>www</code> domain to their DNS providers. Instructions are updated to reflect same in the <code>Blog Dashboard &gt; Domain</code> page.<br></p><img src="./cffcb528ecba49ed7be7a8e7a8da4328"></li><li><p>At the moment, the <code>www</code> subdomain can only be mapped form <code>Blog Dashboard &gt; Domain</code>.
